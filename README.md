# Ollie

A small floating Lark companion for macOS. A bright duck head rests at the right
edge of the screen; click it for a compact panel with your unread Lark chats,
pinned chats and, optionally, a conversation with a coding-agent "Control"
session running in [Paseo](https://paseo.sh).

Ollie is a standalone app on Lark's public Open API. It does not patch, read or
automate the Lark desktop client.

## Features

- **Edge head.** Rests at the right screen edge; ⌥Space or a click opens the
  panel. Drag the panel's header to move it; drop it against the right edge to
  dock it again. Reduce Motion stops every animation.
- **Lark and All chats.** Unread activity first, with previews, mute and
  mark-read. All chats pages through your full chat list.
- **Pinned chats.** Up to ten in the rail (⌘1–9). Drag to reorder.
- **Conversations.** Text, rich posts with links, mentions and images, card
  text, images (open, save, copy), files, voice and video (saved through the
  authenticated Lark resource API), shared chats and contacts, forwarded
  bundles and system events. Replies quote their parent; edits, recalls,
  threads and bots are marked. Messages from one sender in the same minute
  group together.
- **Companion (optional).** Opens the real Companion web app in its own
  resizable window with a persistent session, configured with
  `ollie companion set --url http://host:port`.
- **Control seat (optional).** Talk to a Paseo agent session from the panel:
  readable replies with Markdown, named speakers, a live activity row, the
  work between replies (commands, edits, checklists, failures) folded into
  one line that opens to each step, visible errors and notifications, and
  names of Lark people and groups linked to their chats.
- **Needs you.** The head pulses for an open ask from your Control's runner
  or a Paseo request (permission, plan, question), until you have seen it.
  Each request shows what it asks and opens in Paseo to answer.
- **Notifications (opt-in).** Optional macOS banners and sound, never while
  the panel is focused.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later, with the Xcode Command Line Tools (Swift 5.9+) to build.
- A Lark account and a self-built Lark app in your tenant (see Setup).
- Optional, for the Control seat: the Paseo desktop app (0.14) on the Mac and a
  reachable Paseo daemon that runs your Control agent.
- Optional, for open asks: a Control runner whose Paseo daemon runs the
  `control-plugins` suite with its read-only `asks.open` RPC.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jl97mcad/sift.git
cd sift
./install.sh        # builds ~/Applications/Ollie.app and ~/.local/bin/ollie
```

Building from source avoids Gatekeeper prompts: release builds are signed
ad hoc, not notarized. An agent can run the whole setup; see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Setup

1. Create a self-built app at <https://open.larksuite.com/app> and enable these
   user scopes (an admin may need to approve them):

   | Scope | Used for |
   | --- | --- |
   | `im:chat:read` | chat list and details |
   | `im:message`, `im:message.send_as_user` | reading and sending as you |
   | `im:message.p2p_msg:get_as_user`, `im:message.group_msg:get_as_user` | direct and group history |
   | `im:chat.members:read` | sender names in groups |
   | `im:resource` | images and files |
   | `contact:user.base:readonly`, `contact:user:search` | names and direct-chat pictures |
   | `offline_access` | staying signed in |

2. Store the app credentials. The secret is read from stdin, never argv:

   ```bash
   printf '%s' "$APP_SECRET" | ollie setup --app-id cli_xxxxxxxx --app-secret -
   ```

3. Sign in with Lark's device flow:

   ```bash
   ollie login --no-wait            # prints a code and a URL to approve
   ollie login --device-code CODE   # after approving in the browser
   ```

   Or press "Sign in with Lark" in the app.

4. Check it:

   ```bash
   ollie doctor
   ollie chats --limit 5
   ```

### Control seat (optional)

```bash
ollie control set --agent-id <paseo-agent-id> --host tcp://<daemon-host>:<port>
ollie control status
```

Or use Settings → Control seat. Ollie sends with `paseo send` and keeps one
connection open through the installed Paseo app's own client: Paseo's events
bring a fresh, bounded, typed timeline when something changes. Only
prompts and replies show as messages; thoughts and tool steps show as labelled,
collapsed work. When a handoff archives the
seated session and exactly one live session on the same host carries its
`seat` label, Ollie follows it. Seats without a `seat` label never move.

Open asks come from the same daemon, through `control-plugins`' read-only
`asks.open` call. Without that suite, asks are off; if the read fails, Ollie
says the state is unknown rather than showing none.

## CLI

Every command prints one JSON object and exits non-zero on failure.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ollie setup --app-id ID --app-secret -` | store app credentials |
| `ollie bootstrap --app-id ID [--agent-id ID --host H]` | credentials + sign-in code (+ seat) on a fresh Mac |
| `ollie login [--no-wait] [--device-code CODE]` | device-flow sign-in |
| `ollie status` / `ollie doctor` | sign-in state; credential, token and chat checks |
| `ollie chats [--limit N]` | chat list |
| `ollie messages --chat-id ID [--limit N]` | one chat's history |
| `ollie pins list \| add <chat_id> \| add --name "Room" \| remove <chat_id> \| clear` | pinned chats |
| `ollie control set \| status \| send "text" \| logs [--tail N] \| digest \| asks \| off` | Control seat |
| `ollie companion set --url URL \| status \| open [--path PATH]` | Companion window |
| `ollie selftest` / `ollie open` / `ollie logout` | geometry self-test; open the app; forget the session |

## Privacy and data

- Everything stays on your Mac, in `~/Library/Application Support/Ollie/`:
  `credentials.json` (app secret and tokens), `state.json` (pins, settings,
  Control seat) and `cache.json` (chat list and previews), each mode 0600.
  Device-only preferences use macOS user defaults.
- Ollie talks only to Lark's Open API and, if you set a Control seat, to that
  Paseo daemon. There is no telemetry and no third-party service.
- Notifications are off until you enable them.

## How it works

- Lark has no push channel for personal messages, so Ollie polls. Each tick
  reads the 20 most active chats once and fetches previews only for the top
  two and for chats that moved up; the open chat is read every tick, and pinned
  chats too while the panel is open. The interval is configurable.
- The API has no unread counter. Ollie remembers the last message it showed per
  chat and marks newer messages from other people as unread.
- Direct chats list no picture and the contact profile endpoint may refuse a
  user token, so pictures come from user search, matched on the exact person.
  Otherwise initials show.

## Known limits

- Reads trail the native client by a few seconds. With the panel collapsed, a
  new message is found from the chat list's activity order, which Lark updates
  up to about 20 seconds after the message.
- The Control read depends on the Paseo desktop app's internal layout (0.14).
  A different version may fail visibly with "Paseo conversation data is
  unavailable"; Ollie then falls back to reading every 15 seconds.
- The live Control connection keeps one Paseo helper process running (about
  190 MB of memory, close to no CPU at rest).
- Control history shows the latest 80 timeline entries, up to 400 with
  "Earlier activity"; older history stays in Paseo. Paseo artifacts are not
  shown yet.
- Stickers cannot be loaded (Lark does not serve them to apps); reactions need
  a scope that is not requested; bold and italic in posts show as plain text.
- Some people's pictures are not searchable and show initials.

## Development

```bash
swift build
CFFIXED_USER_HOME="$PWD/dist/test-home" swift test   # tests need an isolated home
.build/debug/LarkMini --cli selftest
make demo                # dev app with fixture data; no credentials, no network
make app                 # dist/Ollie Dev.app (dev identity)
make check-dev           # assert dist/Ollie Dev.app is the dev identity
make dmg                 # dist/Ollie Dev.dmg
```

`open "dist/Ollie Dev.app" --args --demo` accepts `--demo-chat`, `--demo-control`,
`--demo-needs-you` and `--demo-search`. `make install` builds the real identity
(`Ollie.app`, `com.outlandish.ollie`, `ollie://`). Design decisions are recorded
in [docs/decisions](docs/decisions).
